        <p>The Splyst Profile that you create when you sign up for our Splyst Services contains Personal Information such as your name, username, age, and location. All the information in your Splyst Profile, including Personal Information, that you select to be publicly displayed will be public information and any Splyst Member will be able to view it.  Your username and general physical location will always be publicly displayed.</p>

        <h3>Information Collected Via Technology</h3>
        <p>As you navigate our Website or use the Splyst Services, certain information may also be collected passively, including your Internet protocol address, browser type, operating system, time of day, general physical location, and browser language. Splyst uses this information only in aggregate to determine the composition of our userbase, and the load on our servers, so that we can serve you better.  Splyst will use geographic information regarding your location to display your general location (e.g., city and state).  You may choose to display a different location by editing this information in your Member Profile.  This information is associated with a user identifier for the purpose of improving your Splyst experience, for example to recommend websites that correspond to your profile and interests, including the websites of our advertisers.</p>
        <p>If you are using or logged into the Splyst  Services, or are Browsing with the Toolbar, the Toolbar will transmit to Splyst servers information regarding which pages you view when you visit another member’s profile page, view links.</p>
        <p>Periodically, the Toolbar contacts our servers to see if you are running the most current version of the Toolbar. If necessary, we will automatically provide you with the latest update to the Toolbar.</p>
        <p>An <b>“Internet protocol address”</b> or <b>“IP Address”</b> is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet.  In some cases your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP Address probably varies from session to session.  We track IP Addresses solely in conjunction with session cookies to analyze our web page flow. <b>“Cookies”</b> are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a website.  Cookies can identify you as a unique user of the Website.  Upon your first use of the Toolbar, Splyst sends a Cookie to your computer.  We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on the Website.  Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.  If you choose to disable Cookies, some areas of the Website may not work properly. Splyst uses Cookies to store your preferences. Splyst will not disclose its Cookies to third parties except as required by a valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order.  Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Be aware, however, that the Toolbar may not function properly and you may not be able to utilize all of the functionality of the Services if you refuse cookies.  We may use information collected about you to deliver to you websites, advertisements, or other content we think may be of interest to you.</p>
